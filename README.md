# Ultimate Fractals MT4 ReadMe File

This is the ReadMe file for the Ultimate Fractals MT4 code. 

## About the Code
The Ultimate Fractals MT4 is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify and plot fractals on the MT4 chart.

### Fractal Parameters
The code includes two input parameters:
- `period`: Number of bars to calculate the fractals.
- `volatilityThreshold`: Minimum volatility required to consider a fractal.

### Indicator Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the custom indicator. It adds the indicator buffers, sets the indicator style, arrow symbol, and label.

### Indicator Calculation
The `OnCalculate()` function is the main iteration function of the custom indicator. It calculates the fractals based on the input parameters. It calculates the highest and lowest values within the specified period and checks if they meet the criteria to be considered as fractals. If a fractal is valid, it is plotted on the chart.

### Fractal Validation
The `IsFractal()` function is used to check if a fractal is valid. It compares the current fractal values with the previous and next fractal values to determine if it meets the criteria.

### Strong Trend Detection
The `IsStrongTrend()` function is used to check if a fractal indicates a strong trend. It calculates the volatility using the Average True Range (ATR) indicator and compares it with the volatility threshold.
